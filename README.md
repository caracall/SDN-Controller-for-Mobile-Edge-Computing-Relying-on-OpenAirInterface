# SDN-Controller-for-Mobile-Edge-Computing-Relying-on-OpenAirInterface
This repository contains two python codes that play a big role in the traffic redirection in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). RYU controller is in charge of the traffic redirection. The main application is written in sdn_mec2_ryu.py, and the other code (Northbound_RYU.py) is responsible for the northbound API calls coming from the Mobile Edge Computing Platform Frontend to the RYU controller.
